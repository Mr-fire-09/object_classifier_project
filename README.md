🚀 Object Classifier Project

🎯 Overview

Welcome to the Object Classifier Project! This machine learning-based application is designed to classify objects using a trained deep learning model. The project consists of model training, a graphical user interface (GUI) for seamless user interaction, and a well-structured codebase.
